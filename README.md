Graph is a simple directed graph library written in TypeScript, that provides:

- Ability to add and remove node and edges
- (Partial) topological sort
- Cache paths for cases with (much) more reads than writes
- Export to graphviz `.dot` files

This library has no dependencies and the build artifact is 3.6kB (1.41kB
gzipped).

# Walkthrough

```ts
import { Graph } from "@okcontract/graph";

// nodes are strings
let graph = new Graph<string>();

// add nodes and edges
graph.addNode("a");
graph.addNode("b");
graph.addNode("c");
graph.addNode("d");
graph.addEdge("a", "b");
graph.addEdge("b", "c");
graph.addEdge("c", "d");

// partial topological sort for node "a"
expect(graph.partialTopologicalSort("a")).toEqual(["d", "c", "b", "a"]);

// generate dot graph, with optional types and styles for each node type
console.log(
  graph.toDot(
    {
      string: ["a", "d"],
      number: ["b"],
      object: ["c"],
    },
    {
      string: "style=filled,fillcolor=aquamarine",
      number: "style=filled,fillcolor=gold",
      object: "style=filled,fillcolor=hotpink",
    },
  ),
);
```
